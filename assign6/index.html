        <h2>Overview</h2>

            <div class="col-sm-7 col-md-7">
                <p>You will be implementing all of the features of the ray tracer described in the book, <em><a
                            href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html">Ray Tracing
                            in One Weekend (RTiOW)</a></em>, by Peter Shirley, for this assignment.</p>
                <p>Unlike previous assignments, this time the base code that we give you will be very minimal. It
                    is up to you to implement the assignment how you see fit, however we will be giving you tips on
                    how to structure your code in this document. <strong>Please make sure to read this document
                        carefully</strong>. While the solutions are more or less already given to you in the
                    textbook in C++, GLSL is a very different beast than C++. You will have to implement your ray
                    tracer quite differently from how it is implemented in RTiOW due to the language
                    differences.</p>

                <p>Here are a few good references you may find useful when working with GLSL:</p>

                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Save each task as a

        <h2>Task 1: Implement Chapter 4 of RTiOW <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">0.5 pts</span></h2>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-7 col-md-7">
                <p>The base code simply interpolates the color displayed by the shader depending on the coordinate of
                    the
                    pixel being rendered.</p>
                <p>You are welcome to read Chapters 1 through 3 of <em>Ray Tracing in One Weekend</em>, but GLSL already
                    has a
                    built-in <code>vec3</code> type that we will use for directions, points and colors, so you can skip
                    these chapters.</p>
                <p>Your first task is to implement <a
                        href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#rays,asimplecamera,andbackground"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chapter 4</a>. This part is
                    all
                    about creating rays and much of it will look very familiar from last assignment! Feel free to reuse
                    any code
                    you wrote for that assignment.</p>
                <p>In general, you will notice that there are some difference between the code presented in the book and
                    the
                    code you have been writing in GLSL. For example, you will meet an obstacle while designing the ray
                    class.
                    GLSL does not support object-oriented programming! So you will have to specify your "classes" simply
                    as
                    structs which store information like so:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-glsl">//
// Ray
//

struct ray
{
    vec3 origin;    // this is the origin of the ray
    vec3 direction; // this is the direction the ray is pointing in
};
</code></pre>
                <p>Also, note that structs in GLSL cannot have their own methods and there is no concept of public /
                    private /
                    protected or inheritance in GLSL. So you do not need to implement all of the constructors / getters
                    /
                    setters / or methods that the RTiOW book uses within the class definitions. However, <strong>you do
                        need to
                        create structs to represent your various data structures</strong>. Make sure to also use
                    descriptive variable names and include comments.</p>
                <p>While your structs cannot have explicitly defined constructors, they do have implicitly created ones.
                    As long as you pass in your variables in the same order that your struct's variables are defined you
                    should be good. For example:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-glsl">ray r = ray(vec3(0,0,0), vec3(0,0,-1));</code></pre>
                <p>In this task, you will need to implement a <code>ray</code> struct, which is the same as the one
                    from the
                    last assignment.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-7 col-md-7">
                <p>Chapter 4 uses a fixed resolution and 16x9 aspect ratio. Our shader, however, will render at the
                    resolution of the shader preview window. The
                    variable <code>iResolution</code> tells you the horizontal and vertical resolution. To ensure that
                    your shader renders a properly proportioned image regardless of the size of the shader window, make
                    sure to set the resolution and aspect ratio of your image and camera based on this variable.
                </p>
                <p>At this point you should have a shader which produces an image that looks like Figure 1.</p>

                <p>For this task you <strong>must</strong> implement a struct to represent a <code>sphere</code> object
                    <strong>and</strong> a struct to represent a <code>hit_record</code>. Since GLSL does not support
                    inheritance or
                    dynamically sized lists, you <strong>do not</strong> have to implement <code>hitable</code> or
                    <code>hitable_list</code>.
                    You will not be rendering any objects other than spheres so you do not have to worry about generics.
                    For this assignment all of your spheres will be hardcoded, however, if you wish to make your code
                    nicer you may use fixed length arrays.

                    later chapters).
                    Include it in
                    the top of your shader. <strong>Tip:</strong> Look at how your previous assignment did this, or

                <p>To implement this chapter you <strong>must</strong> create a <code>camera</code> struct, and also you
                    will have to
                    modify your <code class="language-glsl">main()</code> function to take 100 pixel samples by randomly
                    choosing different
                    camera rays.
                    <strong>Note:</strong> there is a much better way of doing this by using Shadertoy channels,

                    <code>common.glsl</code>
                    file.
                    We have implemented a more
                    efficient version than the one described in the book for you. Loops which do not have a fixed number
                    of iterations across pixels are extremely inefficient to use and should always be avoided while
                    programming for the GPU, so we avoided using the rejection sampling method which the book describes.
                </p>
                <p>There is also a bug in the book which makes the diffuse material not exactly correct. When computing
                    the scattered direction after hitting a sphere, make sure to normalize the sum of the normal with
                    the randomly chosen direction on the unit sphere.</p>
                <p>Note: there are two different ways of doing gamma correction. Instead of implementing it the way the
                    book implemented it, our solution utilizes a gamma value closer to the one used in the sRGB color
                    space. Which is done like so:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-glsl">pow(color_val, vec3(1.0/2.2))</code></pre>
                <p>If you use the solution in the book your diffuse material might come out looking a bit darker, but
                    that is fine.</p>

                <p>For this task you <strong>must</strong> implement a <code>material</code> struct and fully
                    incorporate it
                    into your shader. You must also use it to support Lambertian and Metal materials. We recommend
                    organizing your material struct to have three variables. One <code>vec3</code> represents its color,
                    or albedo.
                    One <code>int</code> which represents the type of material that it is, with all of the material
                    types <code>#defined</code> at
                    the top of your shader, and lastly a <code>float</code> which is a material-dependent variable.</p>
                <p>You also <strong>must</strong> have a single <code>material_scatter</code> method which decides what
                    to do
                    based on the type of material that was intersected.</p>
                <p>Note that GLSL already has a built-in <code>reflect</code> function, so you do not need to implement
                    one yourself.

            <div class="col-sm-7 col-md-7">
                <p>Implement progressive rendering by implementing antialiasing through the use of Shadertoy
                    channels/buffers.
                    Remove the for loop you added in Task 4 that loops through 100 samples and only take one sample
                    per call
                    to your shader. Now implement antialiasing (<strong>Hint:</strong> very little code involved. Look
                    at how <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other Shadertoy
                        shaders</a> work, and read the Shadertoy extension documentation. This extension requires that
                    your file
                    serving as the "buffer" writes to the same channel your main file reads from).</p>

        <h2>Task 11: Recreate the cover of the textbook <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">0.5 pts</span></h2>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-7 col-md-7">
                <p>Read <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#wherenext?"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chapter 13</a>. The cover of RTiOW was generated by simply
                    creating random spheres with
                    random material properties, and placing them randomly around the scene. You are to do the same for
                    this
                    task, however, note that if you use the random function like how you have been using it before, you
                    will end
                    up creating different scene configurations every render.</p>
                <p>Currently your random number generator is initialized as follows:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-glsl">init_rand(gl_FragCoord.xy, iTime);</code></pre>
                <p>Your random number generator is seeded based on the current render time which means its generated
                    random
                    numbers will be different every time your shader gets ran. However, you want your spheres to always
                    be in
                    the same, randomly chosen, locations. You can achieve this by re-seeding the random number generator
                    before
                    you do your scene intersection tests to some constant of your choice.</p>
                <p>If you do this final task correctly you should get something similar to Figure 10.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Since the scene composition will depend completely on your choice of seed,
                    your image
                    will not look exactly the same as above</p>
