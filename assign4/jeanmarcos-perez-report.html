                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>In this assignment, you will learn how to implement linear blend skinning for meshes. You will be
                    using
                    Javascript and WebGL to render the results interactively in your browser.</p>
                <h3>Framework</h3>
                <p>Before starting with the assignment, we strongly encourage you to look through the provided
                    framework. The
                    webgl and utility framework is similar to the previous assignments; however, there are some files
                    containing
                    additional classes to which you'll have to add code to complete the assignment. All the locations
                    where you
                    are required to add code have been marked with <strong><code>TODO</code></strong> comments, and have
                    additional
                    info in comments marked with <strong><code>NOTE</code></strong>.</p>
                <p>The <code>joint.js</code> file contains the <code>Joint</code> class that represents a joint and its
                    attached
                    bone. The <code>skeleton.js</code> file contains the <code>Skeleton</code> class that stores all of
                    the
                    joints in an array. The skeleton is organized in a hierarchy where every joint contains a reference
                    to its
                    parent and the root of the hierarchy has its parent set to <code>null</code>. Each joint in the
                    hierarchy
                    can be represented by a local transform with respect to its parent. The <code>mPosition</code> field
                    in the
                    <code>Joint</code> class stores the position of the joint with respect to its parent. The
                    <code>mForward</code> is a unit vector indicating the direction of the local +X axis of the joint,
                    also with
                    respect to its parent. The <code>mUp</code> means the local +Y axis, and <code>mJointAxis</code> 
                    is the local +Z axis, around which the joint can rotate. A real number <code>mJointAngle</code> stores 
                    the current
                    rotation angle of the joint, which should be 0 when it was first initialized. In addition to these
                    fields,
                    the joint also contains a <code>mLength</code> field that stores the length of the corresponding
                    bone in the
                    skeleton hierarchy. Each joint is rendered as a wireframe cube with its corresponding length and
                    orientation.

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-7 col-md-7">
                <p>The local transform of a <code>Joint</code> class is initialized by three vectors passed into its
                    constructor
                    function: <code>head</code>, <code>tip</code> and <code>up</code>. The first two vectors are the
                    coordinates
                    of the two ends of the joint in its parent's coordinate system. And the <code>up</code> vector is
                    perpendicular to the rotation axis, pointing toward the half-plane indicating the rotation
                    direction.<strong></strong></p>
                <p>The <code>skin.js</code> file contains the <code>SkinMesh</code> class that represents the "skin",
                    i.e. the
                    mesh to which the skeleton is bound. The original untransformed vertices for the mesh are stored in
                    the
                    <code>mOriginalPositions</code>, and the transformed ("skinned") vertices are stored
                    in <code>mTransformedPositions</code>. You can use the <code>getVertex()</code> and
                    <code>setTransformedVertex()</code> functions to access the original vertex locations and update the
                    transformed vertex locations, respectively. For smooth skinning, the <code>mWeights</code> array is
                    used to
                    store the weights for each vertex with respect to all the joints in a bound skeleton. You can set
                    and
                    retrieve these weights using the <code>setVertexWeight()/getVertexWeight()</code> functions.
                </p>
                <p>The basecode also has functionality to help you visualize weights for each vertex with respect to
                    each
                    joint. This functionality enables you to understand and debug your weighting code correctly.</p>

        <h2>Task 1: Rigid Skinning (Undergrads: 2 pts Grads: 1.5pts)</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-7 col-md-7">
                <p>In this task, you will implement rigid skinning in the files <code>joint.js</code> and
                    <code>skin.js</code>.
                    The subtasks should be solved in sequential order.
                </p>

                <h3>Subtask 1: Computing Transforms (UG: 1pt G: 0.75pt)</h3>
                <p>For the first subtask, you will have to compute the local, world and binding transforms of each
                    joint.
                    Remember that each joint is specified with a joint location with respect to its parent position and
                    has an
                    axis about which it can rotate.</p>
                <p>A joint's local matrix (which you should compute in <code>getLocalMatrix()</code>) should be the
                    product of a
                    rotation matrix and a local coordinate frame matrix (see <code>Matrix.frame</code> function). </p>
                <p>Once you are confident that your local transformation is correct, you should implement the
                    computation of the
                    world transform matrix for a joint within <code>getWorldMatrix()</code>. This is simply the
                    transform of the
                    parent joint (if any) multiplied by this joint's local transform. You've already implemented
                    something
                    similar in a previous assignment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-5 col-md-5">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-7 col-md-7">
                <p>Once you have computed the world transform of the joints correctly, you can go ahead with computing
                    the
                    binding matrix of each joint in the <code>computeBindingMatrix()</code> function. The binding matrix
                    is
                    computed when the joint is aligned with the associated mesh in the "binding pose". The binding
                    matrix is
                    used to transform a point in world-space to a point in the local space of a bone; it is simply the
                    inverse
                    of the joint's world matrix at the time of binding.</p>

                <h3>Subtask 2: Computing Rigid Skinning (Undergrads: 1pt Grads: 0.75pt)</h3>
                <p>Once you've successfully computed the previous task, you can go ahead and implement the rigid
                    skinning within
                    the <code>rigidSkinning()</code> function in the <code>skin.js</code> file. For now, each vertex in
                    the mesh
                    is only attached to one bone. You can figure out which bone a vertex is attached to using the
                    <code>getRigidlyAttachedJoint()</code>function. You should then transform the vertex using the bone
                    transform; see the pseudo code in the JS file for more information.

                <p>In this task, you will perform linear blend skinning, which helps you create smoother meshes under
                    animation.
                </p>
                <h3>Subtask 1: Point-Line Nearest Distance Computation (1 pt)</h3>
                <p>In this first subtask, you will have to compute the nearest distance from a point to a line segment.
                    You will
                    have to add your code to the <code>computeDistanceToLine()</code> within the <code>skin.js</code>
                    file. This
                    function takes in a point and the two vertices that make up the line. Note that it's not as easy as
                    computing the distance to a line, because we are considering a line <strong>segment</strong>, there
                    are a
                    few more cases you'll need to consider. Check the comments in the code for some hints.</p>

                <p>Once you've implemented the nearest distance between a point and a line segment, you can use this to
                    compute
                    the vertex weights. The vertex weight for a particular bone tell you how much that bone "influences"
                    the
                    vertex, and we will compute the weights as a function of distance from the vertex to the bone. You
                    will have
                    to implement a weighting strategy within the <code>computeLinearBlendedWeights()</code> function
                    that
                    considers the inverse of the distance raised to the fourth power (1/distance<sup>4</sup>) of each
                    vertex to
                    the bone. You can use the previously discussed weight display code to help you debug problems
                    associated
                    with this task.</p>

                    bones.

                    blend
                    skinning code. Look at the <code>skin.js</code> file and implement the
                    <code>linearBlendSkinning </code>function. With rigid skinning, you only transformed the vertex
                    position using one joint; now, you transform it with every joint in the skeleton, and do a weighted
                    average
                    of all transformed positions using the vertex weights. See the pseudo code in the JS file for more
                    info. If
                    you've implemented this task correctly, your mesh will look similar to Figure 4.

                <h2>Task 3: Skinning A Custom Mesh (1pt)</h2>
                <p>In this task, you will combine everything you've implemented in previous tasks to rig a provided arm
                    mesh.
                    You need to create new joints and manually place them on locations along the arm. At a minimum,
                    there should
                    at least be 3 bones (the upper arm, middle arm and wrist). We have already provided the locations of
                    the
                    first two bones for your convenience. You can use these positions to get an idea of how to place the
                    additional joints. To get full points for this task you should use additional joints within the
                    fingers to

                <p>Graduate students must perform a procedural animation of the arm and undergraduates may do so for
                    extra credit. At each time interval you should update the rotation angle of the individual joints to
                    create
                    a realistic motion. Get creative!</p>
